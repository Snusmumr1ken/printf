# printf()

This function writes the C string pointed by format to the standard output. If format includes format specifiers (subsequences beginning with %), the additional arguments following format are formatted and inserted in the resulting string replacing their respective specifiers.

My printf implementation works with the following specifiers: d or i, u, o, x, X, f, F, c, s, p, %.

This project was done during my education at UNIT Factory (Kyiv, Ukraine).
